I used _Textwrangler_ as my universal text editor and it did a good job. But since I discovered _Atom_ I feel like I missed a few years of development.    
Here is a quick overview of what I discovered so far:
* you can install custom packages, e.g. for _Jekyll_ or a markdown preview
* Git support is built in
* custom themes, e.g. dark
* it is free

I'll keep digging and post new discoveries.

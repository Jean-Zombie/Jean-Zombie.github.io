Here is a nice [video](https://youtu.be/W5WE9Db2RLU) from Pycon 2017. It shows a quite lengthy analysis of a dataset mostly with pandas involved. The research question is if black football players are more likely to get a red card then others. The presentation covers everything from
1. hypothesis building
2. operationalizing
3. data cleaning and wrangling
4. choosing and performing statistic analysis

Fun fact from the presentation: Jupyter Notebooks have something called _Cursor Magic_. If you press `alt` + `cmd`(on mac) you can place multiple instances of the cursor in a cell. This allows for editing multiple lines with similar code.
